# heart-disease-prediction-ml
A machine learning project to predict heart disease using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network models. Includes data cleaning, EDA, model training, evaluation, and comparison of performance metrics.

# Project Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to leverage data science to identify potential heart disease risk factors and classify patients based on their health attributes.

# Model Used
  *Logistic Regression: For baseline classification performance.
  * Decision Tree: For interpretable, rule-based predictions.
  * Neural Network (Pytorch): For deep learning pattern recognition.
# Technologies & Tools
  *Languages: Python
  *Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  *Environment:  Google Colab
